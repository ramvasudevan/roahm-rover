- Follow coinbrew quickstart at coin-or.github.io/ipopt/INSTALL.html
- Do something like the following
    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir Ipopt_home
    $ cd Ipopt_home
    $ mkdir coinbrew_master
  Put the coinbrew script here
    $ coinbrew-master/coinbrew fetch Ipopt
    
  - At this point install the HSL (Harwell Subroutines Library) (download from internet, need email link) to get access to better linear subsolvers. Unpack the file in Ipopt_home/ThirdParty/HSL and rename to coinhsl.
    $ cd ThirdParty/HSL
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    
  - Finish up installing Ipopt. The HSL build will be skipped, which is what we want since we installed it separately.
    $ cd ../
    $ coinbrew-master/coinbrew build Ipopt
    $ coinbrew-master/coinbrew install Ipopt
    
  - To link the libraries make sure the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH is correct
  Do something like
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH/home/nvidia/Ipopt_home/dist/lib/:/home/nvidia/Ipopt_home/ThirdParty/HSL/.libs
    
  - Then issue 
    $ pip2 install --user ipopt
    to install the cyipopt wrapper. You might have to make sure the cyipopt.c file from the coinbrew installation is visible on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
